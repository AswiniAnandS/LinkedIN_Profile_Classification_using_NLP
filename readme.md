The objective of this project is to optimize candidate selection by integrating the best classification model with a chatbot for user interaction. I leveraged scikit-learn to build and assess various classifier models, including decision tree, random forest, Gradient boosting, and GaussianNB. The random forest model achieved the highest accuracy at 82% on test data. Also, I enhanced interactivity by incorporating an NLTK-based chatbot for real-time prediction results.
